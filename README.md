## My process

## Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**: Ensures better accessibility and meaningful content structure.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For easier theming and consistent styling.
- **Flexbox**: Used for flexible layout designs.
- **CSS Grid**: Provides a robust layout system for complex designs.
- **Mobile-first Workflow**: Design approach focused on optimizing mobile user experience first.

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in web development, particularly in creating structured HTML and responsive CSS. Here are some highlights:

1. **HTML Semantics and Structure:**
   - Learned the importance of using semantic HTML tags like `<figure>`, `<section>`, and `<ul>` to enhance content organization and accessibility.

   ```html
   <section class="main-content">
     <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
     <p class="content">An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal.</p>
   </section>
   ```

2. **CSS Grid and Flexbox Layouts:**
   - Improved understanding of CSS Grid for list layouts and Flexbox for overall layout adjustment.

   ```css
   .ingredients ul {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: 1.25rem 1fr;
     gap: 0.8rem;
   }
   ```

3. **Responsive Design Techniques:**
   - Enhanced responsive design using media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.

   ```css
   @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
     .main {
       width: 90%;
       padding: 2rem;
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Typography and Custom Fonts:**
   - Worked with custom fonts and created a consistent visual hierarchy using different font families and weights.

   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: "Outfit";
     src: url("./fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
     font-weight: 400;
   }
   ```

5. **Theming with CSS Variables:**
   - Leveraged CSS variables for easier theming and consistent color usage across the project.

   ```css
   :root {
     --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
     --stone-600: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
     --brown-800: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
   }
   ```

6. **Accessibility Considerations:**
   - Focused on accessible content structure, including clear headings, descriptive alt attributes, and logical navigation.

These learnings have strengthened my front-end development skills and provided a better understanding of web accessibility, design systems, and responsive layouts.
